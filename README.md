# ClassLibrary
Some helpful classes.
## Components
* [**Berrysoft.Console**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Console)
Some classes about parsing command lines, XML settings files, and JSON files. A class to write simple log.
* [**Berrysoft.Data**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Data)
Some complex data structure for convenience, e.g., BinaryTree&lt;T&gt;, Graph&lt;T&gt;, KeyDictionary&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt;.
* [**Berrysoft.Unsafe**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Unsafe)
Some unsafe structs and methods, which make unsafe command available to languages like Visual Basic.
* [**Berrysoft.Workflow**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Workflow)
Some experimental classes implementing IExecutable or IExecutor.
I've been thinking of avoiding recalls which may cause [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but this project may NOT a good solution.
* [**Berrysoft.Tsinghua.Net**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Tsinghua.Net)
I used to complain about TUNet, which is a software to login our campus network with an unbelievable low speed.
* [**Berrysoft.Tsinghua.Physics**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Tsinghua.Physics)
This is an experimental project being built.
I hope it will make it easier to download files from our FTP, post forums on our [JKParadise](http://jkparadise.space/), and browse our own wiki.
