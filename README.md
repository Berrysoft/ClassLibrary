# ClassLibrary
Some helpful classes.
## Components
### Developing
* [**Berrysoft.Console**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Console)
Some classes about parsing command lines and XML settings files. A class to write simple log.
* [**Berrysoft.Data**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Data)
Some complex data structure for convenience, e.g., BinaryTree&lt;T&gt;, Graph&lt;T&gt;, Map&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt;, MultiMap&lt;TKey1, TKey2&gt;.
* [**Berrysoft.Unsafe**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Unsafe)
Some unsafe structs and methods, which make unsafe command available to "safe" languages like Visual Basic.
* [**Berrysoft.Tsinghua.Net**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Tsinghua.Net)
I used to complain about TUNet, which is a software to login our campus network with an unbelievable low speed.
### Experimental
* [**Berrysoft.Workflow**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/src/Berrysoft.Workflow)
Some experimental classes implementing IExecutable or IExecutor.
I've been thinking of avoiding recalls which may cause [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but this project may NOT a good solution.
### Document
* [**Berrysoft.Documents**](https://github.com/Berrysoft/ClassLibrary/tree/master/doc/Berrysoft.Documents)
A SHFB project to build my own document of these classes.
